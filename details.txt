Hi Aakash here, i just built a login and registration system which can register,login 
and search your forgot password or username.

On running the source code, the compiler asks for the choice.
1.login
2.registration
3.forgot your username or password
4.exit

*it has 5 void functions such as: 
1.login();  //when you enter choice =1 and enter username and password. it searches for the entered username
              and password in the external text file and gives successful result when both are present in  
              as key value pairs
2.regstr();  //when you enter choice =2 and enter username and password. it 
              registers the username and password in the external text file
3.forgot(); //when you enter choice =3, it asks for 
             1.forgot your username 
             2.forgot your password
4.forgotbyusername();  //asks for password and searches for username and returns it
5.forgotbypassword();  //asks for username and searches for password and returns it
